# Real_or_Not-NeuralNetworkExperiment
A project in Colab (Python, Keras, Tensorflow) that can tell the difference between a real or a fake face. This is an experiment to see if using a traditional neural network or a convolutional neural network is better for the task at hand.


To test this, I made two neural networks: one Unsupervised using Dense layers and another that's a CNN and is Unsupervised. After these models were trained (fitting information in their respective Colab files) I put them to the test by giving them real and fake faces as well as their labels. The traditional neural network (with dense layers) seemed to perform better than the CNN.
